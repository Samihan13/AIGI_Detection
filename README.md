# AIGI_Detection

The models are stored at the location - AIGI_Detection/models
This folder contains -
1. ResNet50 Transfer Learning model with fractal dimension layer and custom loss function
2. Self-supervised pipeline for ResNet50 with pretext and downstream task divided into 2 files
3. The model Notebooks contain the actual models + trainer + config - all in one file

# General idea behind the project:
The primary task of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning in detecting images generated by Generative model using a modified ResNet model and compare it with self-supervised pipeline. The results will be posted in a single study to judge the effectiveness of each model and how addition of each layer/loss affects the final results.

To do this, we'll be using CIFAKE dataset which has 120,000 images split into REAL and FAKE folders having 60,000 images each. There will be a further 80:20 split between 'train' and 'test' sets.

The modified ResNet model will first have the pretrained weights based on IMAGENET dataset. The final layers would be modified to include 'fractal dimension analysis' using box-counting method. Further, the loss function would include 3 parts - Cross Entropy Loss + Cosine Similarity Loss + Confidence Penalty that would take advantage of the fractal layer mentioned above.
